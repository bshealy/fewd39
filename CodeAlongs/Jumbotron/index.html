        <p>
          A masterpiece of Biblical scope, and the magnum opus of one of America’s most enduring authors.
        </p>
        <h4>Little Women <i>by Louisa May Alcott </i></h4>
        <p>
          Little Women "has been read as a romance or as a quest, or both. It has been read as a family drama that validates virtue over wealth", but also "as a means of escaping that life by women who knew its gender constraints only too well".
        </p>
        <h4>Mountains Beyond Mountains <i>by Tracy Kidder</i></h4>
        <p>
          In Mountains Beyond Mountains, Pulitzer Prize—winning author Tracy Kidder tells the true story of a gifted man who loves the world and has set out to do all he can to cure it.

        </p>
        <h4>The Story of the Lost Child <i>by Elena Ferrante and Ann Goldstein</i>
        </h4>

        </p>
        <h4>Between the World and Me <i>by Ta-Nehisi Coates</i></h4>
        <p>
